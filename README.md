Standalone companion script implementation of LZ Penalty with SGLang's custom logit processor.

This script makes it easy to test out LZ penalty as a demo. However, custom logit processor requires adding a custom class into your Sglang instance.

For an older but more performant sglang fork with LZ penalty support, see: https://github.com/tginart/sglang
